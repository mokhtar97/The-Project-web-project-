 <div id="ww"> We all know how important a resume is in today's corporate world.<br>
  An impressive resume can help you stand out from thousands of potential candidates and land you the job you always dreamed of.<br>
  But what should your resume include is the biggest question that often plagues candidates mind and a wrong detail can land your resume in the bin.</br>
  Just list where you worked, what you did and where you went to school, attach that to each application and press the button. In fact, though,</br>
  you have considerable flexibility in how you structure your resume. </br>
  The decisions you make about what it says and how it looks can affect whether you get the job you really want, or get a job at all. </br>
  Every resume and cover letter is started with one goal in mind â€” strategically market the candidate for the desired position.</br></div>
